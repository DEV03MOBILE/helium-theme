## Overview

Designed from scratch, Helium theme provides more clean and modern look and feel.

Main features:

* CSS variables are used for colors. As a result it's possible to apply different color presets on the fly, 
without theme recompilation and app restart.
* Built-in size presets (small/large/medium), also switchable in runtime.
* Settings screen.
